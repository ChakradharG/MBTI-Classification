# MBTI-Classification
Our solution to [this kaggle problem](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type). This is the end semester project for [Estimation, Detection and Learning (CMU)](https://courses.ece.cmu.edu/18752)

<br>

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository
* `cd MBTI-Classification`
* Download the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type/download) and extract the file into `MBTI-Classification/data/`

<br>

## How to Use
* Run `main.py` (`python3 main.py --nc` if running for the first time)
* Use other flags (`--l`, `--d`, etc.) to control hyperparameters (see `main.py > get_args` function for more details)
